<p><font color="pink">The Great Gatsby is a 2013 American historical romantic drama film based on the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars an ensemble cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki.[4] Filming took place from September to December 2011 in Australia, with a $105 million net production budget. The film follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his neighbor Nick Carraway (Maguire) who recounts his interactions with Gatsby amid the riotous parties of the Jazz Age on Long Island in New York.

A polarizing film among critics, The Great Gatsby received both praise and criticism for its visual style, direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, and interpretation of the source material. Audiences responded more positively,[5] and Fitzgerald's granddaughter praised the film, stating "Scott would have been proud."[6] As of 2023, it is Luhrmann's highest-grossing film, grossing over $353 million worldwide.[7] At the 86th Academy Awards, the film won in both of its nominated categories: Best Production Design and Best Costume Design.</font>
